			<small>Legends tell of the olden times of the year 2018.</small><br>
			<small>Pyramids were erected and rose to untold heights, only to fall in ruins.</small><br>
			<small>Farms expanded all over the land, consuming endless resources in their rampant growth.</small><br>
			<small>Mythical creatures such as dragons, heroes and kittens appeared in droves.</small><br>
			<small>~~~ <img class="icon-align-center biggericon" src="img/kitty.png" alt="[a cryptokitty]"> ~~~</small><br>
			<small>There is no greater tale of these times than the saga of snails and shrimps.</small><br>
			<small>With the bloom of late spring, Nature came to life.</small><br>
			<small>Denizens of the land and the sea burgeoned, in a new era of prosperity.</small><br>
			<small>But not everyone saw this golden age so kindly.</small><br>
			<small>~~~ <img class="icon-align-center biggericon" src="img/snail.png" alt="[the snailfarm snail]"> ~~~</small><br>
			<small>Machine, the timeless enemy of Nature, decided to set the world ablaze.</small><br>
			<small>In dark factories, wasting no time, armies of bots were manufactured.</small><br>
			<small>Sent out with only one goal: to suck out the lifeforce of the universe itself, Ether.</small><br>
			<small>And so, the golden age gave way to mechanical dread.</small><br>

				<div class="question">
					<h4>Nice story and all, but what is this?</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					SnailThrone is a decentralized game where you raise your nest of snails with love and care, grow their numbers, then mercilessly sacrifice them to the great glory of the snail gods, which lets you become a god yourself, somehow.<br><br>
					Snails aren't known for their brainpower. Good thing you're here to guide them!<br>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>Give me the less flowery rundown.</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Spend ETH to buy snails.<br><br>
					Sacrifice snails to claim the throne.<br><br>
					Stay on the throne long enough without anyone else kicking you off, and you win the pot.<br>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>Is that it?</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Your snails continuously lay eggs, which you can hatch for even more snails. Who doesn't like more snails?<br><br>
					But the soulless monsters out there could instead feed their snail eggs to the FrogKing, for an ETH reward.<br><br>
					Simply holding snails entitles you to part of the ETH spent on any buy or hatch transaction.<br><br>
					You can also sell your snails back to the game contract.<br>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>Wait... Why would I buy snails only to sell them later?</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					The cost of snails rises and decreases, relative to their total supply. The more snails around, the higher the price.<br><br>
					With the right timing, you could buy snails low and sell them high.<br><br>
					You will also earn ETH between the time you buy and the time you sell if other players buy and hatch snails, as some of the ETH is distributed to snail holders.<br>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>I get it. This is one of those cryptocurrency scams I was warned about!</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Good on you for being careful. This is the right attitude to have in this space.<br><br>
					SnailThrone is a smart contract on Ethereum. It will run exactly as designed, 24/7, without possible interference from cheaters or developers.<br><br>
					The code is <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xbE08A0169249F1C9ee4Adb472e1BF4580Ec91403" target="_blank">open source and can be checked on Etherscan</a>; which means even if *you* can't personally understand code, other people with the ability to do so could raise the alarm if there was anything wrong.<br>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>Will I become a millionaire from this game?</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					You could become a snail millionaire, if you hatch your eggs long enough.<br><br>
					Rewards are directly proportional to the volume of players involved. The more people involved, the more ETH up for grabs.<br><br>
					First, understand this is a zero-sum game and not an investment. The gains of any player come from the losses of another player.<br><br>
					You shouldn't play with ether you can't afford to lose!<br>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>What do I need to play?</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					As with most DApps, you will want to have the <a href="https://metamask.io/MetaMask" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> extension or another compatible Ethereum wallet.<br><br>
					You will also need ETH, to pay for transactions as well as the game itself.<br><br>
					There is <a href="https://snailking.github.io/snailthrone_testing/game.html" target="_blank">a "trial" version of the game available on the Ropsten network</a>.<br><br>
					ETH is free on the Ropsten network, so you can familiarize yourself with the rules of the game in a safe environment.<br>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>I'm a marketer/youtuber and I have an audience.</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					You're in luck then: we have a referral program.<br><br>
					Whenever snails are bought through your own personalized link, you receive 6% of the ETH spent.<br><br>
					Said ETH would have gone to the pot otherwise, so you can stress this to your followers:<br>
					There's nothing to lose in SnailThrone by using a referral link!<br><br>
					Note: a minimum of 300 snails is required for your referral link to be active, which should be around 0.01 to 0.04 ETH.<br>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>I read this whole page and I still can't find what I want to know.</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Come have a chat on <a href="https://discord.gg/JU8P4Ru" target="_blank">Discord!</a><br><br>
					Snails are a friendly bunch, and we'd be glad to have you around.<br><br>
